# Music Genealogy Explorer

This project is a minimal React + Vite application that visualizes how musicians are connected through shared band memberships using data from the MusicBrainz API.

The initial demo loads Dave Grohl's bands and displays them using React Flow. Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

To run locally:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
